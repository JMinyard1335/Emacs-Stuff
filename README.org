* Introduction 
Welcome to my Emacs configuration! This reapo is a collection of different modifications I have made to my Emacs configuration. I have been broken these configurations in to easy to customize modules that can be used independently of each other.

* Installation
To install this reapo run the command below in a directory of your choice I tend to stick it in my home dir 

For HTTPS:
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/JMinyard1335/Emacs-Stuff.git
#+end_src
For SSH
#+begin_src bash
  git clone git@github.com:JMinyard1335/Emacs-Stuff.git
#+end_src

Once you have cloned the repository you can copy init file from the directory named after your operating system of choice to your ~/.emacs.d/  or simply follow along with the instructions in the setup section of the readme
